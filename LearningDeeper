 What is a Task? 
 A task is an Object that represents a work that should be done. 
 A thread is a small set of executable instructions. 
 We use tasks to execute sth in parallel. 
 The Task class represents a single operation that does not return a value and that usually executes asynchronously. 
 Task objects are one of the central components of the task-based asynchronous pattern first introduced in the .NET Framework 4.
 
 what is asynchronous programming in c#?
 It does not wait for current statement to complete its execution before moving to next statement.
 Our three approaches 1. Callbacks 2. Promises 3. Async/Await handles the asynchronous programming.

Type Checking: typeof, GetType, or is?
'typeof' takes a type name (which you specify at compile time).
'GetType' gets the runtime type of an instance.
'is' returns true if an instance is in the inheritance tree.
